*QUESTION 1:*Create a function called *fizzBuzz* to return 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz', or the argument it receives, all depending on the argument of the function, a number that is divisible by, 3, 5, or both 3 and 5, respectively.When the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the number itself should be returned.

*QUESTION 2:*Create a function called *aritGeo* that takes one argument, an Array. You are required to check if the array passed as an argument is arithmetic, geometric, neither arithmetic nor geometric in progression or if the array is empty.For arithmetic progressions, return ArithmeticFor geometric progressions, return GeometricFor neither of the above, return -1For an empty array, return 0

*QUESTION 3:*Write a *getPrimes* function that takes an integer value n as argument and generates prime numbers from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis. The generated prime numbers should be in an array. If no prime number is obtainable for the input, return an empty array.Your logic should be as efficient as possible (with minimal iterations).Your code should also address edge cases (invalid input, negative input value, or zero as input).

Please write your own Jasmine tests with at least 5 test cases.
